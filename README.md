## the future of content creation

in a rapidly evolving digital landscape, the demand for captivating and interactive content has never been higher. traditional gifs are charming, but we're taking it a step further by introducing the concept of *collages*. each collage is a work of art, with every image thoughtfully 'stacked' in the center, creating a mesmerizing poster-like effect. but that's just the beginning.

## seamless integration of sound

unlike conventional gifs, *web3-revolutionized-gif-maker-5000-with-sound* empowers you to integrate sound seamlessly into your creations. choose audio from youtube links and precisely select timestamps for the audio clip to synchronize it perfectly with your collage. the result? a multimedia experience that captures your audience's attention like never before.

## explore the code

this repository houses the very essence of this innovative toolâ€”the core 'business logic' that drives its functionality. while we've intentionally omitted elements necessary for runtime execution, such as *requirements.txt*, *runtime configurations*, and *container configurations*, you can delve into the codebase to gain insights into the intricate algorithms and mechanics behind this revolutionary project.

### logging and celery setup

to provide a glimpse into the codebase, let's take a look at a snippet responsible for setting up logging and configuring celery, an essential component of our tool:

```python
celery_app = Celery(
    __name__,
    broker='amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672//',
    backend='rpc://',
    include=['tasks']
)

celery_app.conf.update(
    task_serializer='json',
    accept_content=['json'],  # Ignore other content
    result_serializer='json',
    timezone='Europe/London',
    enable_utc=True,
)

celery_app.log.setup_task_loggers()

__all__ = ['celery_app', 'logger']
```
In a single form submission, your entries will become a GIF (with sound).
```python
chain = (
    download_images_task.si(board_url, output_directory) |
    download_youtube_audio_task.si(youtube_url, start_time, end_time, "/app/downloaded_images/youtube_audio.mp3") |
    combine_images_and_video_task.si(output_directory, "/app/downloaded_images/youtube_audio.mp3", output_video_path, 10)
)
result = chain.apply_async()
```
