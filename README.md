## Explore the Code

This repository houses the very essence of this innovative toolâ€”the core 'business logic' that drives its functionality. While we've intentionally omitted elements necessary for runtime execution, such as *requirements.txt*, *runtime configurations*, and *container configurations*, you can delve into the codebase to gain insights into the intricate algorithms and mechanics behind this revolutionary project.

### Logging and Celery Setup

To provide a glimpse into the codebase, let's take a look at a snippet responsible for setting up logging and configuring Celery, an essential component of our tool:

```python
# Set up logging
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

celery_app = Celery(
    __name__,
    broker='amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672//',
    backend='rpc://',
    include=['tasks']
)

# You can also add other Celery configurations here
celery_app.conf.update(
    task_serializer='json',
    accept_content=['json'],  # Ignore other content
    result_serializer='json',
    timezone='Europe/London',
    enable_utc=True,
)

# Ensure the logger is configured for use in Celery tasks
celery_app.log.setup_task_loggers()

# Export the logger so it can be imported in other modules
__all__ = ['celery_app', 'logger']
```
